                  orbital kinetic energy density are the local ingredients of
                  a meta–generalized gradient approximation (meta-GGA). We
                  construct a meta-GGA density functional for the
                  exchange-correlation energy that satisfies exact
                  constraints without empirical parameters. The exchange and
                  correlation terms respect two paradigms: one- or
                  two-electron densities and slowly varying densities, and so
                  describe both molecules and solids with high accuracy, as
                  shown by extensive numerical tests. This functional
                  completes the third rung of “Jacob’s ladder” of
                  approximations, above the local spin density and GGA

                  We present a simple derivation of a simple GGA, in which
                  all parameters (other than those in LSD) are fundamental
                  constants. Only general features of the detailed
                  construction underlying the Perdew-Wang 1991 (PW91) GGA are
                  invoked. Improvements over PW91 include an accurate
                  description of the linear response of the uniform electron
                  gas, correct behavior under uniform scaling, and a smoother
