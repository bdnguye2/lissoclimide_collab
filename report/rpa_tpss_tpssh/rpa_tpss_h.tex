\section{Introduction}

Cytotoxic natural products derived from the sea squirt can be useful in cancer
therapeutics or other pharmaceuticals, such as medication
for COVID-19. In cancer treatments, the cyotoxin called chlorolissoclimide induces cell death
by inhibiting translation. Chlorolissoclimide binds to the 80S eukaryotic
ribosome to obstruct the production of proteins. An interesting ribosome-drug
interaction was revealed to form a halogen-$\pi$ bond however,
characteristics of the bond are still unknown. These interactions fall in
the category of halogen bonds. These bonds are noncovalent interactions that
are formed when an electrophilic region of the halogen in a molecule interacts
with a nucleophilic region within another molecule. It forms a $\sigma$-hole
interaction. Research in this specific interaction could help with creating
new cancer therapeutic or improving medication.

Following up with the previous report, random phase approximation (RPA) was
chosen to predict the halogen-$\pi$ interaction because RPA provides a
systematic approach to treating long-range interactions albiet, it may
not be as accurate with Grimme dispersion corrections for some cases. In addition to
these conclusions, we investigated the use of different density functional
approximations (DFAs) for RPA calculations, denoted as RPA(DFA).
The TPSS and TPSSh functionals may describe the halogen-$\pi$ bond more accurately
than PBE and investigated. To determine which functional performs better,
the X40 test set serves as a benchmark for RPA(TPSS), RPA(TPSSh), and
RPA(PBE) calculations. Moreover, the def2-QZVP basis sets were
included to determine whether it may provide a balance between efficiency
and accuracy.

\section{Methods}

Based on the previous report, the 3-4 extrapolation of the RPA
correlation energy was a good balance between efficiency and accuracy.
The X40 Test Set was used to benchmark the method's accuracy for 
noncovalent interactions involving halogens. The test set contains 40
complexes with despersion, induction, dipole-dipole, stack, hydrogen
bond, halogen bond, and halogen-$\pi$ bond interations.

To conserve time, a set of eight complexes from the X40 test set were
chosen based on error from the previous report to study basis set
convergences. A comparison of density functionals was done between
PBE, TPSS, and TPSSh. All calculations were computed with basis sets def2-QZVP,
cc-pVTZ, and cc-pVQZ to compare effects of the basis sets. Within the frozen core approximation,
the RPA energies were computed based on converged orbitals from TPSS and TPSSh, and
resolution-of-identity (RI) was included to improve efficiency. The Hartree
Exact Exchange (HXX) total energy and RIRPA correlation energy were
recorded from the supermolecule and monomers of each complex to compute
interaction energies. The interaction energies from the selected complexes
were extrapolated using the supramolecular approach. Due to the basis set
superposition error (BSSE), 50$\%$ counterpoise corrections (CP) were
applied to the RIRPA correlation energy as well.

For most complexes, the method using the def2-QZVP basis function yields
an error greater than the 3-4 extrapolated, 50 percent CP
extrapolated, and cc-pVQZ.

  \label{fig:complex_1}
\end{figure}

The convergence plot for RPA(TPSS) and RPA(TPSSh) both don't appear to be
converging since the extrapolated lines are nearly parallel. The plot for
RPA(TPSSh) also approaches a value that is more negative than RPA(TPSS).

  \label{fig:complex_8}
\end{figure}

The convergence plots for RPA(TPSS) and RPA(TPSSh) do not appear to
converge. The 50 percent CP and 100 percent CP lines are nearly parallel.

    interactions with fluorine.}
  \label{fig:complex_11}
\end{figure}

Both the RPA(TPSS) and RPA(TPSSh) plots for complex 11 are converging
to one value as they approach 0. The interaction energy for RPA(TPSS)
appears to be negative while the energy for RPA(TPSSh) is positive.

    extrapolation to form linear lines. Complex 24 contains halogen 
    bonding with iodine.}
  \label{fig:complex_24}
\end{figure}

For complex 24, both RPA(TPSS) and RPA(TPSSh) do not converge at all.
The lines for both plots are parallel to each other as they approach 0.

    bonding with bromine.}
  \label{fig:complex_27}
\end{figure}

The RPA(TPSS) and RPA(TPSSh) convergence plots look similar and both don't
converge to one point. The extrapolated lines from cc-pVTZ to cc-pVQZ
appear nearly parallel with each other.

\end{figure}

The convergence plot for RPA(TPSS) and RPA(TPSSh) both do not converge
as the extrapolated lines approach 0. The lines for RPA, 50 percent CP,
and 100 percent CP appear to be parallel.

The convergence plots both don't converge as the lines approach 0. The
extrapolated line from cc-pVTZ to cc-pVQZ for RPA and 50 percent CP
appear to be parallel for the RPA(TPSS) and RPA(TPSSh) plots.

\section{Conclusions}

After investigating the binding energy errors for the X40 test set,
def2-QZVP is revealed to be a good balance between accuracy and
efficiency. The mean error of def2-QZVP,0.603 kcal/mol, is between the
mean error of cc-pVTZ, 0.833 kcal/mol, and cc-pVQZ, 0.576 kcal/mol.
def2-QZVP yields good results compared to cc-pVTZ and cc-pVQZ since it
does not have any CP to correct BSSE.

Using TPSS and TPSSh functionals for RPA do not describe the different
interactions better than PBE. The seven complexes chosen based on error
don't show any improvements because complexes 1, 8, 24, 27, 30, and 38
did not converge. When compared to the results from the previous report,
the error of the 3-4 extrapolation of RPA(TPSS) and RPA(TPSSh) were
greater than the error of RPA(PBE). It is still recommended to use
RPA(PBE) for noncovalent calculations.
